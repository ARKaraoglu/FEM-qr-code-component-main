## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./Desktop.jpeg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. I have practiced my vanilla HTML/CSS skills. It was great since I was doing schoolwork with frameworks all the time and this year, all we did was XML/JSON serialization/deserialization.

2. I have learned how to use `@media`

### Continued development

1. I want to practice and develop my building responsive website skills using `@media` etc.
