## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

1. I have practiced my vanilla HTML/CSS skills. It was great since I was doing schoolwork with frameworks all the time and this year, all we did was XML/JSON serialization/deserialization.

2. I have learned how to use `@media`

### Continued development

1. I want to practice and develop my building responsive website skills using `@media` etc.
